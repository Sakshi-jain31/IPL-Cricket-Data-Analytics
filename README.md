# IPL-Cricket-Data-Analytics

Data Science / Analytics are all about finding valuable insights from the given dataset. In short, finding answers that could help business. In this tutorial, we will see how to get started with Data Analysis in Python. The Python packages that we use in this notebook are: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sea born
Since usually such tutorials are based on in-built datasets like iris, it becomes harder for the learner to connect with the analysis and hence learning becomes difficult. To overcome this, the dataset that we use in this notebook is IPL (Indian Premier League) Dataset posted on Kaggle Datasets sourced from cricsheet. IPL is one of the most popular cricket tournaments in the world, thus the problems we try to solve and the questions that we try to answer should be familiar to anyone who knows Cricket.
Questions:
•	Calculating team score & tram extra columns for each match, each innings?
•	Calculating Batsmen aggregates (Runs, Balls, 4s, 6s, SR)?
•	Calculating Bowler Aggregates?
•	Team Wins in home city vs. other cities?
•	Performance of top 5 batsmen over seasons?
•	Percentage of total runs scored through boundaries for each batsman?
•	Performance of top bowlers over season?
•	Extra runs conceded by bowlers?
•	Player of the match?
•	Impact of toss on the match outcome?
